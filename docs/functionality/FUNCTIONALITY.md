# LiberAI Functionality
The LiberAI project aims to create a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) AI assistant that can understand and respond to user queries. This document outlines the desired functionality for the LiberAI system.

## Core Features
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: LiberAI should be able to process and understand human language, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The system should be able to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge graph or database to answer user queries.
3. **Dialogue Management**: LiberAI should be able to engage in conversation, using context and understanding to generate human-like responses.
4. **Intent Identification**: The system should be able to identify the user's intent behind their query, such as seeking information, asking for help, or making a request.
5. **Response Generation**: LiberAI should be able to generate responses that are relevant, accurate, and engaging.

## Advanced Features
1. **Contextual Understanding**: The system should be able to understand the context of the conversation, including previous queries and responses.
2. **Entity Disambiguation**: LiberAI should be able to disambiguate entities, such as distinguishing between different people or places with the same name.
3. **Emotional Intelligence**: The system should be able to recognize and respond to emotions, such as empathy or humor.
4. **Multi-Language Support**: LiberAI should be able to understand and respond to queries in multiple languages.
5. **Extensibility**: The system should be designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality as needed.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Programming Language**: The system should be built using a programming language that is well-suited for NLP and AI tasks, such as Python or Java.
2. **Framework**: LiberAI should use a framework that provides a solid foundation for building AI applications, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. **Database**: The system should use a database that is optimized for storing and retrieving large amounts of knowledge, such as a graph database or a relational database.
4. **API**: LiberAI should provide an API that allows developers to interact with the system programmatically.

## Future Development
1. **Continuous Learning**: The system should be able to learn from user interactions and improve its performance over time.
2. **Community Engagement**: LiberAI should be designed to engage with the open-source community, encouraging contributions and feedback from developers and users.
3. **Security and Privacy**: The system should be designed with security and privacy in mind, ensuring that user data is protected and secure.

This document provides a starting point for the LiberAI project, outlining the desired functionality and technical requirements for the system. As the project evolves, this document will be updated to reflect changes and additions to the system's functionality.
