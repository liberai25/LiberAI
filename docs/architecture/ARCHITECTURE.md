# LiberAI Architecture
LiberAI is a large language model designed to process and generate human-like text. The architecture of LiberAI is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is well-suited for natural language processing tasks.

## Components
The LiberAI architecture consists of the following components:

* **Encoder**: The encoder is responsible for converting input text into a continuous representation that can be processed by the model.
* **Decoder**: The decoder.
* **Decoder**: The decoder is responsible for generating output text based on the continuous representation produced by the encoder.
* **Attention Mechanism**: The attention mechanism is used to focus on specific parts of the input text when generating output text.
* **Feed Forward Network**: The feed forward network is used to transform the output of the attention mechanism into a higher-level representation.

## Data Flow
The data flow of the LiberAI architecture is as follows:

1. **Input Text**: The input text is passed through the encoder to produce a continuous representation.
2. **Encoder Output**: The output of the encoder is passed through the attention mechanism to produce a weighted sum of the input text.
3. **Attention Output**: The output of the attention mechanism is passed through the feed forward network to produce a higher-level representation.
4. **Decoder Input**: The output of the feed forward network is passed through the decoder to produce output text.
5. **Output Text**: The output text is generated based on the output of the decoder.

## Training Objectives
The LiberAI architecture is trained using a combination of the following objectives:

* **Masked Language Modeling**: The model is trained to predict the missing tokens in a sentence.
* **Next Sentence Prediction**: The model is trained to predict whether two sentences are adjacent or not.
* **Perplexity**: The model is trained to minimize the perplexity of the output text.

## Evaluation Metrics
The LiberAI architecture is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Perplexity**: The perplexity of the output text is used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **BLEU Score**: The BLEU score is used to evaluate the model's performance on machine translation tasks.
* **ROUGE Score**: The ROUGE score is used to evaluate the model's performance on text summarization tasks.
